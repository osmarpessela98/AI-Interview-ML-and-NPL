# AI-Interview-ML-and-NPL

This Python script demonstrates a simple AI interview simulation, where the program randomly selects a term from a provided dataset and prompts the user to describe it. The program then calculates the cosine similarity between the user's input and the correct answer using the SentenceTransformer library.

## Installation

Make sure you have the required libraries installed:

```bash
pip install transformers
pip install sentence-transformers
